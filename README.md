# Weather Dashboard

In this project we were asked to use the Open Weather Api to create an application that displayed the current weather along with a forecast for a user selected city. The city was also supposed to be saved on the page for the user to return to if they wished to. To accomplish this local storage was used so that the results would remain between user sessions. Additionally I wanted to make sure something was displayed on the page when the user returns so I applied the last searched for city on page load for convenience.

I chose to utilize the Bootstrap framework for my search bar and city list on the left side of the page as well as the forecast cards at the bottom. I also used Moment JS to display the current and relative dates on the page.  Finally I utilized Google Fonts and Font Awesome for some minor styling on the page. Images of the deployed application can be seen below.
